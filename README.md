# E-news Express Project

This project used statistical analysis, A/B testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) was effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset had certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that were used to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language was also analyzed in this project.

Key Skills: 
Hypothesis Testing, A/B testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference, Business Statistics
